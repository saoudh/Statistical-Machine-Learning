# Statistical-Machine-Learning
Code and jupyter notebooks of the following topics will be included in this repository:

* Naive Bayes using gaussian probability density function (pdf): Using gaussian pdf it will be possible to quantify uncertainty of the inference

* non parametric algorithms like Kernel Density Estimate and K-Nearest Neighbour using gaussians as kernel

* Gaussian Mixture

* Support Vector Machines

* (Bayesian) Linear Regression

* Linear Classification

* Principal Component Analysis

* Neural Networks

* Gaussian Processes
